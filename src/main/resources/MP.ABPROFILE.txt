The function **MP.ABPROFILE** computes the AB join in the context of matrix profiles by comparing every subsequence in two input Geo Time Series (GTS). Both GTS must be bucketized and filled, producing an output GTS whose length and metadata are determined by the first GTS, with value reflecting the matrix profile result and elevation indicating the argmin bucket index referencing the second input GTS. The parameters include **gts1** (first operand), **gts2** (second operand), **sub.length** (number of points in a subsequence), and an optional **macro** (custom macro for comparing two subsequences that outputs a numerical value). The output parameter is **result**, which represents the matrix profile. Related functions include **MP.PROFILE** and **MP.RPROFILE**. This function falls under the tags **extensions** and can be categorized as part of matrix profile calculations within data analysis frameworks. Additional configurations can be managed through settings like **mp.abprofile.maxsize** and **mp.abprofile.maxsize.capname**.
