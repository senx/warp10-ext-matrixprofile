The function **MP.ATBUCKETINDEX** is designed to return a subsequence Geo Time Series (GTS) starting from a specified bucket index number, necessitating that the input GTS is already bucketized. It takes three parameters: **gts**, which is the input GTS, **sub.length**, representing the desired length of the subsequence, and **bucket.index**, which indicates the starting index of the row from which the subsequence is extracted; the output is given as **result**, signifying the resultant sub GTS. This function is related to **MP.RPROFILE** and is categorized under the **extensions** tag, indicating its utility in extending functionality related to time series data manipulation.
