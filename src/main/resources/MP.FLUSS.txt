The function **MP.FLUSS** is designed for performing fast, low-cost unipotent semantic segmentation based on the results from a matrix profile. It accepts three parameters: **profile**, which is the input Geo Time Series (GTS) that must be a matrix profile result; **sub.length**, which specifies the length of the subsequence; and **result**, which outputs the arc curved regularized cross counts. This function is related to **MP.PROFILE** and is categorized under tags such as 'extensions'. It belongs to the extension **io.warp10.ext.matrixprofile.MatrixProfileWarpScriptExtension**.
